# Used Car Market Analysis & Prediction

## Data-Driven Insights and Predictive Modeling for the Used Car Market

### Project Overview
The **Used Car Market Analysis & Prediction** project focuses on extracting valuable insights from a comprehensive used car dataset and building predictive models to estimate vehicle prices. This repository demonstrates a complete data science workflow, from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation. The goal is to understand the factors influencing used car prices and provide a robust tool for price forecasting.

### Key Features

* **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:** Handles loading, cleaning, and preparing raw used car data, addressing missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducts in-depth analysis to uncover patterns, correlations, and key insights related to vehicle attributes and their impact on pricing. Includes visualizations to represent data distributions and relationships.
* **Feature Engineering:** Transforms raw data into meaningful features for machine learning models, potentially including categorical encoding, numerical scaling, and creation of new features.
* **Machine Learning Model Development:** Implements and evaluates various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting) for used car price prediction.
* **Model Evaluation:** Assesses model performance using relevant metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared) and cross-validation techniques.
* **Interactive Notebooks:** Utilizes Jupyter Notebooks to present the analysis workflow step-by-step, making the process transparent and reproducible.

### Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
* **Core Data Science Libraries:**
    * Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
    * NumPy (for numerical operations)
    * Matplotlib (for data visualization)
    * Seaborn (for enhanced statistical data visualization)
    * Scikit-learn (for machine learning model implementation, preprocessing, and evaluation)
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook (for interactive development and presentation)
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

### Getting Started

To set up and run this project locally, you will need Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.

#### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed on your system.
* `pip` (Python package installer).

#### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourGitHubUsername]/used-car-market-analysis.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd used-car-market-analysis
    ```
3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
4.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (Ensure you create a `requirements.txt` file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing all libraries used in your notebook.)

#### Running the Project

1.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2.  Your web browser will open to the Jupyter interface.
3.  Click on `used_car_dataset.ipynb` to open the main analysis notebook. You can run cells sequentially to follow the entire data science workflow.
4.  The `used_car_dataset.py` file contains the script version of the core logic, which can be run directly from the command line if preferred:
    ```bash
    python used_car_dataset.py
    ```
